Problem 27 :
The Boyer-Moore voting algorithm is one of the popular optimal algorithms which is used to find the majority element among the given elements that have more than N/ 2 occurrences. 

This works perfectly fine for finding the majority element which takes 2 traversals over the given elements, which works in O(N) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.

Input :{1,1,1,1,2,3,5}

Output : 1

Explanation : 1 occurs more than 3 times.

Input : {1,2,3}

Output : -1
